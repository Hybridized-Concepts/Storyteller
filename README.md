[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Hybridized-Concepts/Storyteller/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Hybridized-Concepts/Storyteller/tree/main)

A Repository for the Storyteller Content Archive and Community Suite of Modules and Plugins. This project is an attempt to create a Content Managment System focused on creating fictional and non-fictional content with support for ebook downloads, world building and information wiki services, and content structure. Monitization is also planned, but no ideas on how yet.

## World Builder

World Building is the wiki function for the entire setup. Here you can create back ground information, character profiles, and definiaitons for how a lot of the world works. 

## Bookshelf

The actual structure for creating, sorting, displaying, and grouping stories in the system. This system includes both a cover page content type, chapter content type, and ways to sort and reference stories.

## Book Maker

Downloading entire stories as ebooks for more easy reading and storing in your personal archives. If you enjoy this method we recommend using [Calibre eBook Management](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to help organize your collection and maintain it to your prefere ebook devices.
