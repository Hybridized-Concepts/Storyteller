A Repository for the Storyteller Content Archive and Community Suite of Modules and Plugins. This project is an attempt to create a Content Managment System focused on creating fictional and non-fictional content with support for ebook downloads, world building and information wiki services, and content structure. Monitization is also planned, but no ideas on how yet.
